    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        We begin each collection with motion. If a garment can’t flex through a warm‑up, breathe through a commute,
        and still feel clean in class, it doesn’t make the cut. We prototype multiple versions of each piece and
        test them with real students and athletes. The result is a steady balance between performance details—reinforced
        seams, breathable panels, durable inks—and daily wear comfort like soft handfeel and relaxed drape.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our visual language keeps a low profile: bold when it needs to be, quiet when it should be. Typography and color
        are chosen to complement skin tones and campus backdrops. We avoid disposable trends in favor of silhouettes
        that still look fresh a year from now. That’s not minimalism for minimalism’s sake—it’s respect for your closet
        and your budget.
    </p>


    <h2>Sustainability & Ethics</h2>
    <p>
        We source from mills that document fair labor practices and reduce water usage where possible. Limited drops
        help
        prevent overproduction and waste. Packaging is recyclable and sized to reduce fillers. We’re not perfect, but we
        publish what we’re learning each season so the community can hold us accountable. If you know a better material
        or supplier, tell us—collaboration is part of the culture.
    </p>


    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>
        A portion of proceeds from campus pop‑ups supports student‑run initiatives—mutual aid funds, club travel, and
        creative showcases. We partner with local photographers, designers, and athletes to keep the ecosystem thriving.
        If you’ve got a project that uplifts people, reach out. We’d love to amplify it.
